/*
	Develop a command-line program that will take 2 csv files (1 with sales data, 1 with department name mapping), join them together, and report back the sales per department
	sorted by sales amount in descending order in a csv output to the console.
	
	Example Output:
	"Department Name","Sales Amount"
	Pets,519832.23
	Outdoors,235434.50
	Electronics,110034.00
	Shoes,56700.56
	"Men's Clothing",23421.56
	
	NOTES:
	* THIRD-PARTY LIBRARIES MAY BE USED FOR CSV HANDLING (ex: 'org.apache.commons:commons-csv:1.1' has been added to the pom.xml, but other libraries may be used instead)
	* UNIT TESTS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED
	* USE 'data/problem2' FOR TESTING
